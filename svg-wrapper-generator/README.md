            The <code>FlexibleMenuBar</code> container accepts each object's 
            <code>width</code> and <code>padding</code> / <code>margin</code> 
            applied to it as props.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on the total space available and total objects passed to the 
            component, it calculates how many objects can be displayed in the 
            menu bar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also, we may want some objects to displayed all the time and hence
            we also have <code>leftConstData</code> and 
            <code>rightConstData</code>. These are <code>arrays</code> through
            which we can pass the constant data.
          </li>
          <li>
            And, we pass the variable objects/items to be displayed in the form
            of array and can be declared in <code>allDataList</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
